      <h2>Process and Terms of Service, Please Read Carefully.</h2>
      <p class="bold">
        I typically work Monday to Friday.
      </p>
      <p>
        I Prefer email to confirm commissions but it is also possible to reach me through Twitter, Discord and Instagram if we are mutual on those platforms.
      </p>
      <p>  
        I have many styles of art but please do not ask me to copy or replicate another artists' style or image.
        Files will be PNG, sized accordingly.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>I do not do vector illustrations for regular commissions.</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        If you require a higher resolution commission or intend to use it for merchandising please let me know in advance as this will be considered a special request and may come with additional charges.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you require different sizes, resolutions, prefer RGB vs CMYK, please let me know in advance.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Client <strong>MUST</strong> provide as much information and visual reference as possible, if I am required to do research, you will be charged hourly for me having to do so.
      </p>
      <p>
        If I am expected to come up with an entire image based on very little to no information or references, an additional Character Design charge will be added on top of the original Commission fee.
      </p>
      <p>
        Two revisions are included, one after the preliminary design and one at the final stages of design. Any additional, even minor changes will be charged by the hour @ $20/hr.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>I accept all payments through PayPal.</strong> I send drafts and sketches for revision purposes only. Please do not save or upload them to social media.
        You can reserve a slot in the waitlist for a down payment of $10 CAD. This is non-refundable. I will assign you a number and add you to a list after we discuss your commission fully via email.
      </p>
      <p>
        Please wait for me to discuss the commission fully and confirm it with you before sending any payments.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you have a deadline for the commission please tell me up front, I appreciate patience during the time that I do commissions as it guarantees the best results, times can vary from 1 day to 2 weeks depending on the difficulty of the project.
      </p>
      <p>
        I will only start a commission after being sent a partial or full payment. Expect to receive a draft of your commission within 1 week of paying.
      </p>
      <p>
        I ask that you credit me appropriately for the final product when and where such credit may be reasonably provided. I must also be allowed to display the work in a portfolio or on social media for personal marketing purposes at an agreed time after the completion of the project.
      </p>
      <p>
        I reserve all rights of reproduction and all copyrights to the commission, the preliminary design, and any incidental work made in the creation of the commission. You can purchase the rights to the commission at an added cost that can be discussed during the commission process.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>I am not responsible for the content on clients' websites or pages.</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        Client <strong>is</strong> allowed to:
        <ul>
          <li>Print and use the commissioned piece for personal use, but please remember: I do not do vector illustrations for regular commissions. If you require a higher resolution commission or intend to use it for merchandising please let me know in advance as this will be considered a special request and may come with additional charges.</li>
          <li>Make stickers out of the commission for personal use. Do not redistribute the pieces for commercial use.</li>
          <li>Claim the rights to their character/s in the piece, not the piece itself.</li>
          <li>Post the commissioned piece on social media, use it as a display photo on any platform. Credit is always appreciated!</li>
        </ul>
      </p>
      <p>
        The Client <strong>is not</strong> allowed to:
        <ul>
          <li>Intentionally destroy, alter, modify, or change the piece in any way without permission.</li>
        </ul>
      </p>
      <h2>Refunds, Cancellations, Ownership & Copyright.</h2>
      <p>
        <strong>Title of the commission remains with me until I am paid in full.</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        If the Client does not approve of the preliminary design and wishes to cancel the commission the artist shall keep all payments made and the agreement shall terminate.
      </p>
      <p>
        I reserve rights to terminate the agreement in the event the Client is more than 30 days late in payment.
      </p>
      <p>
        I reserve the rights to move onto other work/projects and the Client may lose their place in line, if they take more than 3 days to respond to questions/messages regarding the commission.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Client may terminate this agreement if the Artist fails without cause to complete the Work within 30 days of the completion date stated herein. In the event of termination, the Artist agrees to return to the Client all payments made to the Artist.
