## Here shall be all things needed by DesertWhale!

A simple roadmap of features to come.

 - As a portfolio-page should include, there will be links to various profiles such as Ko-fi, Instagram etc. to showcase artworks. :art:

- There will be a section to include links to and clips from Twitch streams. :red_circle: :movie_camera:

- A simple about page to describe the artist! :scroll:

- Eventually add a contact/order form for potential clients. :pencil:

- Integrate some fancy/subtle animations such as progress bars :heavy_check_mark:
